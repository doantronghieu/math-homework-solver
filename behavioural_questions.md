# Behavioral Questions - Growtrics Interview

## 1. What attracted you to our startup?

Growtrics addresses a critical gap I've observed firsthand: while AI can solve complex problems instantly, most students still struggle with homework across all subjects due to lack of personalized guidance. Your mobile-first approach to AI-powered learning resonates deeply with my experience at VTC Education, where I built LLM-based chatbots that delivered educational content and streamlined learning interactions, giving me direct insight into how conversational AI can enhance understanding across diverse academic topics.

What excites me most is the vision for generalized homework problem-solving across all subjects, not just mathematics. Having developed computer vision systems for exercise monitoring and conversational AI for automotive interfaces, I understand the technical complexity of building AI that can interpret handwritten text, understand academic context across disciplines, and provide step-by-step explanations whether it's solving calculus problems, analyzing literature, or explaining scientific concepts. Your assessment challenge perfectly aligns with my experience combining OCR, LLMs, and multimodal interfaces to create systems that understand diverse input formats.

The startup environment appeals to me because it enables rapid iteration with emerging technologies while staying close to student needs. At FPT Software, I saw how large organizations move slowly with AI adoption, while startups can leverage cutting-edge frameworks like LangChain and LangGraph to create breakthrough solutions. Growtrics' commitment to democratizing quality education through accessible AI reflects the impact-driven work I want to pursue—helping students who might otherwise struggle with any subject due to lack of individualized support.

I'm particularly drawn to the challenge of scaling personalized tutoring across all academic disciplines. My automotive AI assistant served individual users, but educational AI must understand diverse learning styles, academic skill levels, and subject-specific contexts across millions of students studying everything from algebra to history to chemistry. The opportunity to solve this technical challenge while directly helping students overcome academic anxiety and build confidence across all subjects makes Growtrics the perfect next step in my mission to build truly transformative AI applications.

## 2. Where do you see yourself 5 years from now?

In five years, I envision myself as a technical leader building comprehensive AI education platforms that serve millions of students across all academic subjects globally. Based on my progression from individual contributor to leading complex AI projects, I see myself architecting scalable educational systems that combine my expertise in LLMs, computer vision, and multimodal interfaces to handle everything from mathematics and science to literature and history.

My immediate goal is becoming a senior engineer who can influence product architecture and technical strategy for cross-curricular AI tutoring. Drawing from my experience across automotive, content creation, and educational AI, I want to lead the development of learning platforms that adapt to individual student needs across diverse subjects—similar to how my automotive AI assistant processes contextual commands, but applied to personalized academic support spanning multiple disciplines.

By year three, I aim to manage a team of engineers building the next generation of subject-agnostic educational AI. My cross-domain experience has taught me that the most impactful AI applications require understanding both technical capabilities and pedagogical psychology across different academic fields. I want to lead teams that think beyond just solving homework problems to creating systems that build student confidence and curiosity across all areas of study.

Ultimately, I want to drive the technical vision for AI education platforms that achieve measurable learning outcomes across the full curriculum spectrum. My goal is contributing to solutions that demonstrably improve student performance metrics—not just engagement scores, but actual comprehension and retention rates in subjects ranging from STEM to humanities. I'm particularly passionate about developing AI that can work effectively in bandwidth-limited environments, ensuring educational equity globally across all academic disciplines.

The path forward involves continuous learning in emerging AI technologies while developing the leadership skills needed to translate technical possibilities into products that genuinely transform how students learn and teachers teach across every subject area.

## 3. Why did you leave your previous jobs (if applicable)?

Each transition in my career has been driven by a desire to work on increasingly impactful AI applications and gain broader technical exposure. At VinBigData, I focused primarily on voice biometrics and traditional ML models. While valuable, I recognized that the future of AI lay in large language models and multimodal systems, which led me to VTC Education.

At VTC Education, I gained crucial experience with LLM-based applications and synthetic media, developing chatbots and image generation systems. However, the role was primarily focused on internal tooling rather than products that directly served end users. I wanted to build AI systems that had broader reach and more measurable impact on people's daily lives.

Moving to FPT Software AI Center allowed me to work across multiple industries—automotive, healthcare, and energy—giving me invaluable experience in understanding how AI applications need to be tailored for different domains and user needs. This breadth of experience has been instrumental in developing my ability to quickly adapt AI solutions to new problem spaces.

My transition to IPVM represents my evolution toward building AI-powered products that enhance human productivity and learning. Working on content creation tools and browser extensions has shown me how AI can seamlessly integrate into existing workflows. Now, I'm ready to focus specifically on educational technology, where I believe AI can have the most transformative impact. Each move has been strategic, building toward the goal of creating AI systems that genuinely improve how people learn and solve problems.

## 4. How do you think education can be improved with technology and why?

Having built educational AI systems and observed students struggle with traditional learning methods, I believe technology can address three critical pain points across all academic subjects: the one-size-fits-all approach, delayed feedback loops, and accessibility barriers.

**Personalized Learning Paths:** Traditional classrooms force all students to learn at the same pace, leaving some behind while boring others, whether in mathematics, literature, or science. My conversational AI work taught me how technology can recognize individual patterns—response time, error types, engagement signals. Educational AI can detect when a student repeatedly struggles with algebraic concepts versus literary analysis, then adapt explanations accordingly. This isn't just efficiency; it's about preventing the frustration that causes students to give up on challenging subjects entirely.

**Instant, Contextual Feedback:** When I built real-time computer vision systems for exercise monitoring, I saw how immediate feedback transforms learning. Students currently wait days for graded homework across all subjects, by which time they've forgotten their thought process. AI tutors can catch misconceptions instantly—whether a student confuses chemical formulas in chemistry, misinterprets historical contexts, or makes algebraic errors—and provide targeted correction before bad habits form.

**Multimodal Accessibility:** My browser extension work showed how users prefer different interaction modes. Some students learn better by sketching diagrams for physics, others through verbal discussion for philosophy, or visual aids for biology. Educational AI should seamlessly handle photographed homework pages, voice questions, and diagram interactions within a single interface, regardless of subject matter.

The real breakthrough is mobile accessibility. In Vietnam, I've seen students with smartphones but limited access to subject-specific tutoring. AI-powered mobile assistance can deliver expert-level guidance in any academic discipline to anyone with basic internet access, fundamentally changing educational equity. The goal isn't replacing teachers but ensuring every student has access to personalized academic support across all subjects, regardless of location or economic background.

## 5. If your friends or former employer were asked to comment on 3 good traits and 3 bad traits about you, what would they say and why?

**Three Good Traits:**

**Technical Problem-Solver:** Colleagues would highlight my ability to break down complex AI challenges systematically. When our team at FPT struggled with multimodal automotive interfaces, I proposed combining computer vision with LLM intent classification, leading to a solution that processed voice, gesture, and visual inputs simultaneously. I consistently find creative technical approaches by connecting concepts across different AI domains.

**Rapid Learning & Adaptation:** Former employers would note how quickly I adapt to new technologies and domains. Moving from voice biometrics to educational chatbots to automotive AI required mastering different technical stacks and user requirements within months. At IPVM, I went from knowing nothing about browser extensions to building a AI-powered content editor system in weeks.

**Initiative-Driven:** Friends would say I don't wait for direction. My personal projects—like the AI browser extension—often explore emerging technologies before they become work requirements. I proactively identify problems and build solutions, which has been valuable in startup environments where everyone must drive their own projects.

**Three Areas for Improvement:**

**Impatience with Slow Technical Decisions:** I sometimes get frustrated when teams take too long debating technical approaches when I can see a clear solution. This can come across as dismissive of others' input, especially when working with less technical stakeholders who need more time to understand trade-offs.

**Tendency to Dive Too Deep:** I occasionally spend excessive time on interesting technical challenges when simpler solutions would meet business needs. During my automotive AI project, I over-engineered the natural language processing when basic intent recognition would have sufficed for the MVP.

**Difficulty Delegating Technical Work:** I struggle to let others handle complex technical implementations, often preferring to code solutions myself rather than explaining requirements to junior developers. This can create bottlenecks and doesn't scale well in larger teams.

## 6. If you could buy a billboard anywhere around the world, what would it say and where would it be?

**Message:** "Every question is a doorway to discovery. AI should open doors, not replace curiosity."

**Location:** Times Square, New York City

I'd choose this location because Times Square represents the intersection of technology, diversity, and human ambition—millions of people from different educational backgrounds pass through daily. The message reflects my core belief about AI in education: technology should amplify human curiosity rather than replace the joy of learning.

Having built AI systems that solve complex problems automatically, I've learned that the most powerful educational technology doesn't just provide answers—it helps students understand the thinking process behind solutions. My automotive AI assistant doesn't just execute commands; it explains its reasoning. Similarly, educational AI should foster understanding, not dependency.

The phrase "every question is a doorway" emphasizes that struggling with problems is valuable. When students photograph their math homework for AI assistance, they shouldn't just receive solutions—they should discover new ways to approach similar problems independently. This philosophy has shaped every educational tool I've developed.

Times Square's global audience would ensure this message reaches educators, technologists, and students from diverse backgrounds. In an era where AI can instantly solve most academic problems, we need to remind ourselves that the goal isn't to eliminate challenges but to help students navigate them more effectively. True educational technology success isn't measured by how quickly we can provide answers, but by how well we can nurture lifelong learners who remain curious, confident, and capable of tackling new challenges independently.

## 7. What do you believe is true, but can't prove?

I believe that AI will eventually understand and adapt to individual learning styles so precisely that personalized education will become more effective than traditional classroom instruction for most students across all subjects—but this transformation will happen gradually and imperceptibly.

Having built conversational AI systems that process context from multiple sources simultaneously, I've observed how AI can detect subtle patterns in user behavior that humans miss. In educational contexts, I suspect AI will eventually recognize micro-expressions, response timing, question patterns, and even physiological indicators to understand exactly when and how each student learns best, whether they're studying calculus, analyzing Shakespeare, or learning chemistry.

My experience with multimodal AI applications suggests that future educational systems will seamlessly integrate visual, auditory, and kinesthetic learning approaches in ways that perfectly match each student's cognitive preferences across all academic disciplines. The AI tutor will know whether Sarah learns history better through timeline visualizations or narrative storytelling, whether John grasps physics concepts through mathematical equations or hands-on simulations, and it will adapt in real-time based on their engagement signals.

What I can't prove is the timeline or the specific mechanisms. Current LLMs are impressive but still lack the nuanced understanding of human learning psychology across diverse subjects that would make this vision fully realized. However, my work with intent classification and context-aware AI systems suggests we're building the foundational technologies that will eventually enable this level of personalization across the entire curriculum.

I also believe this will happen so gradually that we won't notice the transition—similar to how smartphone adoption transformed communication without dramatic announcements. One day, we'll realize that most students learn more effectively through AI-powered personalized instruction than traditional methods across all subjects, and it will feel like a natural evolution rather than a revolution. The proof will be in the learning outcomes, not the technology itself.
